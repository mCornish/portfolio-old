Books like <em>The Storytelling Animal</em> and <em>Wired for Story</em> explain that people respond to stories, no matter the context. I wanted to understand why, and how I could use it in my creative work.' +

            'I originally created MikeCornish.net to be a resource that creative minds could use to apply storytelling in new ways. Time constraints kept me from following through on the end goal, but the website remains as my first attempt building a single-page app from scratch.' +

I focused on community, and telling the stories of an often-rejected group of individuals â€” geeks. It seemed to work, getting the attenion of a geeky internet celebrity, Felicia Day, as well as a few sponsors.' +

            '<br><br>' +
            'I try to create my designs like characters, giving them a personality that resonates in their voice, appearance, content, and interactions. People understand and relate to characters, the same way I want them to relate to my designs.' +

            'Most of my design experience comes from leading the design of an on-campus organization and working on small, personal projects, but I\'m currently working on expanding my work to entire brands.'
